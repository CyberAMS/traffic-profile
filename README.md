# traffic-profile
This python program takes an origin and destination and uses the google maps directions API to calculate trip time. The duration of the trip is calculated every minute for the number of hours specified. One of the uses for this tool is to get a profile of how traffic changes throughout the morning or evening to characterize rush hour traffic.
